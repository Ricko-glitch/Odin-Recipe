                <h2>Iran: Kookoo Sabzi (Fresh Herb Frittata)</h2>
                <p>
                    The Persian or Iranian New Year, Norouz, comes in the spring, with an emphasis on rebirth. Seven symbolic dishes are typically served, including this fresh-herb frittata, which is meant to embody the spirit of Nowruz. The green herbs represent new life and the eggs are a symbol of fertility.
